It consists of:</p> <p>Nodes (vertices): Representing data points, such as transactions or blocks. Edges (arrows): Representing relationships between the nodes. The key properties of a DAG:</p> <p>Directed: Each edge has a direction, indicating the relationship between nodes. Acyclic: There are no loops or cycles, meaning you cannot traverse the graph in a way that leads back to the starting point. In Graph Theory, DAGs are widely studied due to their flexibility and efficiency. In the context of blockchain and distributed systems:</p> <p>A traditional blockchain (like Bitcoin) can be thought of as a restrictive DAG, where blocks form a single linear chain. Graphchain expands on this by allowing a more generalized DAG structure, enabling multiple parallel paths and reducing bottlenecks.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#why-use-dags","title":"Why use DAGs?","text":"<p>Graphchain proposes a DAG-based infrastructure that is similar to Bitcoin, but offers much greater scalability. This scalability comes with different security assumptions, which relies on rational actors. </p> <p>DAGs have several advantages over traditional linear blockchain structures:</p> <ul> <li>Scalability: A DAG structure supports parallel transaction validation, allowing the network to process many transactions simultaneously without waiting for a single block to complete.</li> <li>Efficiency: The absence of a linear block structure eliminates the need for mining races, reducing computational overhead and energy consumption.</li> </ul> <p>While Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is technically a DAG with added restrictions, Graphchain leverages the full potential of DAGs to improve scalability without compromising on key features like decentralization.
