The total amount of tokens created follows a linear schedule over the first 6 years, with a maximum of $2^{38} = 274,877,906,944$ tokens created by the end of year 6. There is slightly more weighting to the early years validation effort, which will be explained in detail.

After the first 6 years, the system implements an annual inflation schedule of approximately 3%. The additional tokens are calculated as TOTAL_TOKENS * 0.03 at each anniversary. These tokens are distributed and minable over the year.

## Why Inflationary?
A low, fixed inflation schedule keeps the system dynamic, incentivizes validators to remain active, and encourages the continued use of the system. It also provides later adopters an incentive.

The table below outlines the total tokens created and distributed at each year after the initial 6-year issuance period. The annual, monthly, and fortnightly breakdowns illustrate how tokens are added over time under the 3% inflation schedule.

## Development allocation
83% of the total token supply is allocated through validation efforts. There is no pre-mine; however, an initial allocation is set aside for contributors who have supported the development so far.

At launch, 10% of the total token supply is allocated as follows:
- 6.5%: Initial investors
- 3.5%: Initial developers

An additional 7% of the total supply is allocated on an ongoing basis by the Graphchain Network to support builders and network development:
- Year 1: 2% of the supply becomes available.
- Year 2: An additional 3% of the supply becomes available.
- Year 3: A final 2% of the supply becomes available.
