# Validators

## Testnet Validator Network

The Graphchain testnet is currently operational and available for validators. Validators participate in securing the DAG-network, achiving consensus, and maintaining integrity. We maintain a list of active validators. Tokens are generated periodically for the validation effort.

You can view the **validator list** here: [**Validator List (Testnet)**](http://13.50.162.45/)

## Becoming a Validator & Validator Key Requests

To become a validator on the testnet (and later mainnet), you must request a validator key. This can be done by filling out the Tally Validator Key Request Form:  

[**Request Validator Key**](https://tally.so/r/3E86Ol)

Please ensure you provide accurate and complete information when submitting the form.
Approval is usually fast, but can take more time during busy periods.

## Validator Selection

Validators on the Graphchain testnet are selected at random from the complete set of registered validators, with a limit on newer unverified validators. This random selection process ensures fairness while maintaining network efficiency by only selecting a leader group at each round.

At a high level:
- The validator set is determined periodically.  
- Random selection reduces biases and encourages broad participation. 
- A weighting encourages honest and longer validation times.
