This scalability comes with different, more complex, security assumptions, which relies on rational actors. </p> <p>Nonetheless, DAGs have several advantages over traditional linear blockchain structures. The two most prominent are:</p> <ul> <li>Scalability: A DAG structure supports parallel transaction validation, allowing the network to process many transactions simultaneously without waiting for a single block to complete.</li> <li>Efficiency: The absence of a linear block structure eliminates the need for mining races, reducing computational overhead and energy consumption.</li> </ul> <p>Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is also a DAG, just with additional restrictions which make it linear. Graphchain uses the full potential of DAGs to improve scalability without compromising on key features like decentralisation. </p>"},{"location":"testnet/","title":"Testnet Documentation","text":""},{"location":"testnet/#testnet-demo-explorer","title":"Testnet Demo Explorer","text":"<p>You can find a basic testnet explorer here: Testnet Explorer </p> <p>Note: The explorer is served over <code>http</code> (not <code>https</code>), which may cause browser errors or warnings.</p>"},{"location":"testnet/#important-information","title":"Important Information","text":"<ul> <li>The testnet is part of the ongoing development process.</li> <li>Frequent resets:   The testnet is reset regularly, which may cause temporary downtimes.  </li> <li>Changing Information:   Testnet data and explorer information are frequently updated, so changes in content should be expected.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"testnet/#stay-updated","title":"Stay Updated","text":"<p>For more information, updates, and progress: - Visit the official website: Graphchain.org - Reach out for support if you encounter issues with the testnet: support@lybell.io</p>"},{"location":"tokens/","title":"Tokens","text":"<p>The total amount of tokens created follows a linear schedule over the first 6 years, with a maximum of $2^{38} = 274,877,906,944$ tokens created by the end of year 6.
