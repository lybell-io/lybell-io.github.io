This scalability comes with different, more complex, security assumptions, which relies on rational actors. </p> <p>Nonetheless, DAGs have several advantages over traditional linear blockchain structures. The two most prominent are:</p> <ul> <li>Scalability: A DAG structure supports parallel transaction validation, allowing the network to process many transactions simultaneously without waiting for a single block to complete.</li> <li>Efficiency: The absence of a linear block structure eliminates the need for mining races, reducing computational overhead and energy consumption.</li> </ul> <p>Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is also a DAG, just with additional restrictions which make it linear.
