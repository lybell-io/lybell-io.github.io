It consists of:</p> <p>Nodes (vertices): Representing data points, such as transactions or blocks. Edges (arrows): Representing relationships between the nodes.

In Graph Theory, DAGs are widely studied due to their flexibility and efficiency.

This scalability comes with different security assumptions, which relies on rational actors. </p> <p>DAGs have several advantages over traditional linear blockchain structures:</p> <ul> <li>Scalability: A DAG structure supports parallel transaction validation, allowing the network to process many transactions simultaneously without waiting for a single block to complete.</li> <li>Efficiency: The absence of a linear block structure eliminates the need for mining races, reducing computational overhead and energy consumption.</li> </ul> <p>While Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is technically a DAG with added restrictions, Graphchain leverages the full potential of DAGs to improve scalability without compromising on key features like decentralization. However, this approach requires different security assumptions, relying on rational actors who act in their own self-interest while maintaining network integrity.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#consensus","title":"Consensus","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"testnet/","title":"Testnet Documentation","text":""},{"location":"testnet/#testnet-demo-explorer","title":"Testnet Demo Explorer","text":"<p>You can find a basic testnet explorer here: Testnet Explorer </p> <p>Note: The explorer is served over <code>http</code> (not <code>https</code>), which may cause browser errors or warnings.</p>"},{"location":"testnet/#important-information","title":"Important Information","text":"<ul> <li>The testnet is part of the ongoing development process.</li> <li>Frequent resets:   The testnet is reset regularly, which may cause temporary downtimes.  </li> <li>Changing Information:   Testnet data and explorer information are frequently updated, so changes in content should be expected.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"testnet/#stay-updated","title":"Stay Updated","text":"<p>For more information, updates, and progress: - Visit the official website: Graphchain.org - Reach out for support if you encounter issues with the testnet: support@lybell.io</p>"}]}
